## Overview

The spread of misinformation and fake news is a significant challenge in today's digital world. This project investigates the dual role of AI in this context:
1. **Fake News Detection**: Using AI models to accurately detect fake news. This includes:
   - **RNN Model**: Implemented in `RNN_fake_news_detection.ipynb`, this model achieved an accuracy of 97.8% on the test dataset.
   - **BERT Model**: Implemented in `fake_news_detection_mbert.ipynb`, this fine-tuned model achieved a perfect accuracy of 100% on the test dataset.
2. **Fake News Generation**: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude to generate convincing fake news articles.

## Getting Started
### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mamin78/Misinformation_detection_and_generation.git
   cd Misinformation_detection_and_generation
   ```

2. **Download the Dataset**:
   Ensure you have the dataset in the `data/` directory. The dataset includes labeled news articles used for training and evaluation.

3. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Open the Jupyter notebooks `RNN_fake_news_detection.ipynb` and `fake_news_detection_mbert.ipynb` to explore and execute the models for detecting fake news.
   - Follow the instructions in each notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Results

- **RNN Model**: Demonstrated an impressive accuracy of 97.8% in detecting fake news.
- **BERT Model**: Achieved a perfect accuracy of 100%, showcasing its robustness in handling natural language tasks.
- **LLM-Generated Fake News**: The models tested on LLM-generated content showed varied performance, highlighting the challenges in detecting sophisticated fake content.
