"After years of railing against rising federal deficits under Democratic presidents, Republicans in Congress have shifted their rhetoric now that a Republican occupies the White House. With the national debt topping $31 trillion and growing, the fiscal hawks who demanded spending cuts and balanced budgets during the Obama and Biden administrations have gone silent. Instead, many Republicans are pushing for stronger military spending and extensions of tax cuts that would add more red ink. They have shown little appetite for reining in expenditures on Medicare, Social Security and other expensive safety net programs. The party's priorities appear to be tax cuts, boosting defense, and avoiding unpopular spending reductions rather than fiscal rectitude. The about-face reflects the typical reversal that occurs when a party assumes the presidency. Governing tends to soften once-rigid ideological stances. But it still marks a striking pivot from the Republican mantra that budget deficits represent generational theft that must be paid by future generations through higher taxes. The looming fight over the federal budget and the need to raise the debt ceiling present an acute test of Republican convictions on spending and deficits. Party leaders must decide whether to make good on campaign trail rhetoric about fiscal restraint or to keep punting on hard choices as their predecessors often did."
"The U.S. military will begin allowing transgender recruits to join its ranks on Monday, following an order from a federal judge that rejected the Trump administration's request to continue a ban. The Department of Defense has agreed to remain obligated to preserve and protect the rights of prospective recruits under the court orders as they currently exist, said Pentagon spokeswoman Jessica Maxwell. The decision comes after U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled in October that the transgender service member ban, originally approved by President Donald Trump in 2017, was likely unconstitutional. The judge subsequently declined to put that decision on hold in December, after the administration provided revised reasons for banning transgender recruits. Under previous rules, transgender individuals were precluded from joining the military. However, those already serving were allowed to continue doing so and receive hormone treatment and gender-transition surgery. The Trump administration had argued that the integration of transgender recruits could impact military readiness and effectiveness. Critics countered that thousands of transgender individuals already serving had not undermined the military's lethality. While the Pentagon will comply with the court order, it leaves open the possibility of future legal challenges over the issue by the Trump administration. More than a dozen other countries, including Israel, Sweden and the United Kingdom, already allow transgender personnel to serve openly."
"A senior Republican senator issued a stern warning to President Trump and his allies amid escalating attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation â€“ urging them to allow Mueller to complete his probe without interference. The country needs to get the facts out there, and Mr. Mueller and his team should do their jobs, said Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina in an interview. When they get done with this investigation, that report needs to be public. Tillis, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is adding his voice to a growing chorus of Republican legislators counseling against firing Mueller. His remarks come as some pro-Trump conservatives have intensified criticism of the special counsel, accusing his team of political bias. The White House has denied any intention of firing Mueller amid speculation Trump was considering dismissing him over alleged conflicts of interest. But the attacks on Mueller's credibility have nonetheless fueled concerns he could be dismissed before completing his investigation into Russian interference and potential collusion with Trump's 2016 campaign. I would never support dismissing Mr. Mueller unless there were constitutional reasons to do so, said Tillis, who said Mueller should be allowed to see his probe through to its conclusion unimpeded. Other key GOP senators have issued similar warnings in recent days, underscoring there could be severe backlash from Congress if Trump attempts to remove Mueller from his post."
"The FBI's investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia was initiated after a diplomat for Australia provided information related to campaign aide George Papadopoulos, according to a report by The New York Times. In May 2016, Papadopoulos had disclosed to the Australian diplomat that Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton during a conversation in Britain, the Times reported, citing current and former American and foreign officials. Papadopoulos's comment struck the Australian as significant given the Russian hacking of Democratic emails that soon became public. The Australian government then notified U.S. officials of the conversation, helping spur the FBI's counterintelligence investigation in July 2016. Details of how the probe began have been closely guarded by the FBI and intelligence agencies. The revelation that a diplomatic partner provided the initial evidence shows how U.S. allies played an important supporting role in the case. The Times report also provided new context around the interest in Papadopoulos by the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Russians offering dirt on Clinton. While President Trump and allies have cast the Russia investigation as a witch hunt, the new details suggest the FBI was simply following up on a legitimate tip from an allied nation. The fact that an American on the campaign trail appeared to have known about Russian hacking efforts before they became public helped compel the FBI to investigate further."
"President Donald Trump escalated his attacks on Amazon on Friday, saying the U.S. Postal Service should charge the e-commerce giant and other companies much more for shipping packages. In a tweet, Trump claimed that Amazon and other shipping companies are causing tremendous loss to the Postal Service by taking advantage of shipping rates that he described as making a dying enterprise out of the service. The Postal Service is a wonderful franchise, but it is being guided very poorly. I don't want to put millions of people out of work, Trump said. It loses a fortune, and this will be straightened out. The Post Office should raise.... prices on the companies shipping packages until costs are realized! Amazon and the Postal Service have an agreement for the delivery company to transport the retailer's packages in the mail's last-mile from delivery hubs to residences. While package delivery has been a bright spot for the Postal Service amid declining mail volumes, critics like Trump contend the service's rates don't fully cover its costs for each shipment. Amazon has disputed Trump's claims that it shortchanges the Postal Service, saying the arrangements are profitable for the mail carrier. It has also noted that no U.S. company is required by law to pay the full institutional costs of the Postal Service delivering packages. Trump has long criticized Amazon and founder Jeff Bezos over issues like taxes and the sale of products on its platform. His latest broadside could potentially set up a showdown over postal rates that analysts say could raise costs for Amazon and other large shippers while boosting prices for consumers relying on package delivery."
"The White House and Republican leaders in Congress are gearing up for high-stakes negotiations over federal spending and immigration policy as the new year begins. With budget caps expiring and just months until midterm elections, the pressure is on to strike deals to fund the government and resolve the status of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants. Top priorities for the White House include boosting military spending, funding the border wall, and finding a solution for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. President Trump ended DACA last year but gave Congress until March to legislate a replacement. Democrats are insisting that protections for DACA recipients be included in any spending bill. They also want equal increases for non-defense spending to match any extra funds for the Pentagon. The negotiations set up a series of fiscal battles that could lead to a government shutdown if compromises cannot be reached. Both sides know the political consequences of a funding lapse ahead of nationwide congressional elections in November. Key players are already staking out positions. The White House said it wants $33 billion in additional defense spending and $18 billion for border security, including initial funds for the wall. Democrats called those numbers unacceptable. Lawmakers must agree to raise strict budget caps before undertaking longer-term spending negotiations. The last caps expire on January 19, after which a series of stopgap funding bills have been needed to keep agencies open. With control of Congress at stake, each party is looking to take a win into the campaign season on top issues like immigration and spending priorities. But the talks will test Washington's ability to overcome its perpetual gridlock."
"President Donald Trump expressed confidence that the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election will be fair, but said he has no idea how long the probe will last, according to an interview with The New York Times. I have absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department, Trump said, before adding, But for purposes of hopefully thinking I'm going to be treated fairly, I've stayed uninvolved. The comments come amid heightened tensions between the White House and the investigation team led by Robert Mueller. Trump's lawyers have been negotiating terms for the president to agree to an interview with Mueller's team as part of the widening probe. However, Trump declined to say when a potential interview could occur. I'll see what happens, Trump told the Times when asked about being interviewed. When they have no collusion and nobody has found any collusion at any level, it seems unlikely that you'd even have an interview. The president also did not rule out the possibility of firing Mueller, though he added I'm not saying I'm going to do it. Trump has repeatedly referred to the investigation as a witch hunt and denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. For his part, Mueller has secured charges against four former Trump campaign associates so far related to the Russia probe. He's also investigating whether Trump obstructed justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey last year. Trump said he could have taken a heavier hand with the Justice Department, but believes that would have created too many problems politically. He said he hopes the investigation can go ahead and go ahead with the interviews."
"On Friday, On Friday, December 29th, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to comment on his approval rating and to renew his attacks on Amazon.com Inc. and the U.S. Postal Service. Approval Rating In an early morning tweet, Trump touted his accomplishments and said: While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating, @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec. 28, 2017, was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28, 2009, which was 47%...and this despite massive negative Trump coverage. The president appears to be citing a Fox News graphic comparing his approval rating from different polls to where former President Obama stood eight years earlier. Most reputable approval trackers have shown Trump's rating in the mid-to-low 30s for an extended period. Amazon/Postal Service In a pair of tweets, the president targeted Amazon, claiming the tech giant is taking advantage of the U.S. Postal Service. He stated: Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE! Trump has long criticized Amazon and CEO Jeff Bezos over issues like taxes, jobs and Amazon's business practices. His latest salvos seem to reassert his view that the Postal Service should raise rates on Amazon and other major shippers. The tweets come at a time when the administration is conducting an audit of the Postal Service's costs from delivering packages for companies like Amazon. The Postal Service has pushed back, saying its contractual relationships with Amazon and others provide profitable revenue. Trump ended his tweetstorm by writing: It is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. He did not cite a source for this claim."
"Alabama's Republican Secretary of State John Merrill plans to certify Democrat Doug Jones' victory in the U.S. Senate election today, according to CNN. This comes despite a last-ditch effort by Roy Moore, the defeated Republican candidate, to challenge the result. Merrill told CNN that his office investigated reports of voter fraud from Moore's campaign, but found no evidence to prompt a recount or further delays in certifying Jones as the winner. Our job is to simply report the results and that's what we've done, Merrill stated. Jones defeated Moore by around 21,000 votes in the December 12th special election to fill the Senate seat previously held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. However, Moore, the controversial former Alabama chief justice, refused to concede the race. His campaign cited polls showing Moore should have won and claimed voter fraud tainted the results. Moore's team passed along reports of voter intimidation and suppression to Alabama authorities. But Merrill, the state's top election official, said all the claims were either inaccurate or did not have supporting evidence. He said it was highly unlikely anything that happened could have altered the outcome of the race. Barring an unsuccessful last-second court challenge from Moore, Merrill's certification will officially make Jones the next U.S. Senator from Alabama when the term begins in January. Jones' improbable victory cut the Republican Senate majority to 51-49. The Democrat's upset win was an embarrassing blow for the GOP and President Trump, who endorsed Moore despite allegations he pursued romantic relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. Jones will become the first Democrat to represent Alabama in the Senate in over two decades. "
"Democrat Doug Jones was officially certified as the winner of Alabama's U.S. Senate special election Thursday, despite last-ditch efforts by his Republican opponent Roy Moore to contest the result. Alabama's Republican Secretary of State John Merrill stamped his seal on Jones' victory, officially making the former federal prosecutor the first Democrat to win an Alabama Senate seat in a quarter-century. I legally certified him as the senator for the state of Alabama, Merrill told reporters after the certification. He said his office had investigated all allegations of voter fraud and irregularities made by Moore's campaign but found no evidence to initiate a recount or challenge the outcome. Moore, the controversial former state chief justice, had refused to concede since losing the Dec. 12 election to Jones by nearly 22,000 votes. His campaign pushed unsubstantiated claims of voter intimidation and fraud, while polls showed Moore should have won the deep-red state. However, no court found reason to delay certification. A judge rejected Moore's suit seeking a vote-by-vote recheck, saying he had not provided constitutional frailties to warrant such an inspection. The final certification capped a bitter contest that saw allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers overshadow Moore's campaign. His defeat was an embarrassment for Republicans who had rallied behind the 70-year-old culture warrior despite the accusations. Jones' victory trims the GOP Senate majority to 51-49. His term will run through January 2021, when he would have to run again for a full six-year term. The Democrat struck a unifying tone after the certification, saying he was terribly grateful for the opportunity to serve everybody. Meanwhile, Moore maintained the Senate race had been tainted by outside groups favoring Jones."
"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo sharply criticized the newly-passed federal tax overhaul on Friday, questioning whether key provisions may violate the U.S. Constitution. Cuomo said his state is considering legal action over elements he termed an economic civil war. The Democrat took particular aim at the tax bill's $10,000 cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes from federal taxable income. This could substantially increase taxes for many New Yorkers with high property and income taxes. This was an offensive move by the federal government to help Republican states at the cost of Democratic states, Cuomo said at a cabinet meeting in Albany. That's a clear violation of constitutional principles. Cuomo argued the state tax deduction cap unfairly targeted a group of states in violation of constitutional requirements for equal protection and the prohibition of discrimination among states by the federal government. The third-term governor predicted a disproportionate number of tax increases in New York, New Jersey, California and other high-tax states as a result. He claimed the provision effectively rewarded Republican-controlled states with lower taxes at the expense of Democratic-led ones. Cuomo said multiple legal theories were being explored to challenge the constitutionality of the cap, possibly joined by other states. Options included invoking the 10th Amendment's reservation of states' rights and equal protection arguments under the 14th Amendment. The governor warned that retaliatory action was also on the table if the tax overhaul stood as passed. One idea would be restructuring New York's tax code to shift to payroll tax collection as opposed to income taxes as a workaround to the deduction cap. This is a dagger at the economic heart of New York, Cuomo declared, vowing not to let the tax changes pass unchallenged from Albany."
"On December 28th, President Trump took to Twitter to excoriate Vanity Fair magazine and renew his criticism of Hillary Clinton in a series of posts. Vanity Fair Trump first lashed out at Vanity Fair after the magazine apologized for an online video mocking his daughter Ivanka and her White House role. In the video, a Vanity Fair writer suggested celebrating the holiday of the day Donald Trump finally realized his presidency is a sham. Trump tweeted: Vanity Fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit. Anna Wintour, who was all set to be Amb to Court of St James's & a big fundraiser for CH, is beside herself in grief & begging for forgiveness! This appeared to reference the rumored possibility of Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue, getting an ambassador role had Clinton won in 2016. Vanity Fair and Vogue are both owned by CondÃ© Nast. Trump continued in a separate tweet: The good news is that at the request of a great friend, Rubert, they're keeping her small mind intact, at least for the time being!? He misspelled Vanity Fair owner Si Newhouse's first name as Rubert. Hillary Clinton The president then turned his attention to his former Democratic rival with a pair of tweets critical of Clinton. I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to go to jail over the deleted emails and 'the Russians'? He added, without elaborating, My answer: She's being investigated by the good guys in the Department of Justice and FBI. In his next tweet, Trump claimed: The single greatest Witch Hunt in American political history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world are laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control! These tweets reiterated Trump's usual stance denying collusion with Russia despite investigations into the matter. His reference to Clinton seemed to be about her use of a private email server while secretary of state, an issue that dogged her 2016 campaign."
"President Donald Trump took to Twitter to discuss his recent surprise visit to troops in Iraq, U.S. military efforts against ISIS in Syria, and criticism over not visiting a combat zone earlier in his presidency. Visiting Troops in Iraq Trump began by tweeting about his clandestine trip to Al Asad Air Base in western Iraq the previous day, his first visit to a combat zone as president. He wrote: Celebrated Christmas with our great Air Force troops stationed at Al Asad Air Base, Iraq. Nobody better, all over the world, than these people! A wonderful experience! He followed up by thanking service members deployed overseas during the holidays, stating: I had the honor to give out a brand new re-enlistment toy for someone who just joined the fight against cowardly radical ISIS terrorists. Defeating ISIS in Syria The president then turned to discussing the U.S. military campaign against ISIS in Syria, claiming We have defeated ISIS in Syria despite pockets of resistance remaining. He tweeted: We're no longer being played as fools, we're respected again as a Nation! We've defeated ISIS territorially, but a small part still remains, final battles being waged. Criticism Over Not Visiting Earlier Trump also appeared to respond to criticism that he had not visited U.S. troops in harm's way until this week, nearly two years into his presidency. He tweeted: If I had my way, and could fail to get Congressional approval, we'd be out of Syria quickly. Our boys are coming home after getting snubbed by past leaders. They wouldn't let the troops do what they were trained to do. This seemed to reference Trump's repeated desire to withdraw from Syria, which has been slowed by military advisers who warn that ISIS remains a threat. The president frequently laments that past administrations failed to decisively win conflicts. So in his flurry of tweets, Trump highlighted his visit with deployed troops, touted progress against ISIS while calling for withdrawals from Syria, and defended taking time to visit a combat zone as president. The posts offered his perspective on high-profile military and national security issues."
"A California man claims he was behind the delivery of a box filled with horse manure addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's Los Angeles home on Saturday. The man, who identified himself as a psychological operations officer in the Army reserves, said the gift-wrapped package was meant to protest the new Republican tax law. I wanted to send a message, the man told local news station KPCC. People in Congress are being rewarded with millions for their votes on the tax bill from billionaires and corporations and the rest of us are going to get shafted. The man, who requested anonymity, said he used a rental truck to drop off the box labeled Christmas gift in the upscale neighborhood of Bel Air where Mnuchin lives. The box was discovered by a neighbor, who alerted authorities. Los Angeles police spokesman Zak Djerrahian confirmed that a pretty good bulk of manure was inside the package. He said the incident was under investigation. Secret Service agents were also reportedly looking into the matter as a potential security threat to the Treasury chief. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Treasury Department condemned the delivery as unacceptable, saying officials would pursue all legal options against those responsible. The self-described operation officer defended his actions, saying the protest was non-violent but intended to make a strong statement about the new tax code's perceived favoring of the wealthy. With the GOP tax bill considered a giant gift to the richest Americans, I decided to give Mnuchin just a small token of my appreciation, he told KPCC. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, which President Trump signed into law last week, lowers rates for corporations and provides temporary tax cuts for some individuals. Critics argue it disproportionately benefits companies and high-earners over the working class."
"Election officials in Virginia postponed a planned lottery drawing Thursday that was supposed to break the tie in a crucial state House of Delegates race that remains undecided after last month's election. The winner of the Newport News-based 94th District race will determine whether Republicans maintain a 51-49 majority in the House or if the chamber is evenly split with Democrats for the first time since 2000. With the candidates - Democrat Shelly Simonds and Republican incumbent David Yancey - deadlocked at 11,608 votes each after a recount, Virginia law dictates the winner be decided by a random drawing. Officials originally planned to hold the drawing on Thursday by pulling names from a bowl. However, the drawing was postponed after attorneys for both campaigns raised concerns about the lottery's procedures and rules. A panel of three Republican and three Democratic party officials is now working to develop a plan for the tie-breaker that both campaigns find acceptable. This is an unprecedented situation, and we want to ensure we get it right, said Chris Piper, commissioner of the Virginia Department of Elections. The tight race and ultimate necessity of a random drawing underscore how bitterly contested the 2017 Virginia elections were. Democrats made surprising gains in the state after heavily targeting President Trump's policies and behavior. If Simonds wins the lottery drawing, the House would be split 50-50 for the first time since the 1990s. That would likely require Republicans and Democrats to share power in committees and leadership positions. Virginia House Republicans say they are committed to ensuring a fair and transparent process for the random tie-breaker drawing, which must now be rescheduled but legally held by January 10. The stakes are high in the once low-profile district race."
"U.S. congressional investigators have renewed efforts to speak directly with a Russian businessman who attended a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 arranged by Donald Trump Jr., two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. Investigators for the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee want to question Ike Kaveladze, an American based in Russia who works for a Russian developer with ties to the Kremlin, as part of their probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, the sources said. Kaveladze attended the June 9, 2016 meeting after being included on emails setting it up on the promise of providing information that would be damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton."
"Shortly after signing landmark tax cut legislation into law, President Donald Trump resumed his Twitter campaign against former opponent Hillary Clinton on Dec. 26, 2017, writing that Clinton was the biggest whiner in U.S. history after losing the 2016 election but expressing hope that Clinton's recent involvement on the speaking circuit would end up being good money. The comments marked Trump's latest Twitter broadside against his vanquished opponent nearly 14 months after their bitter campaign ended. Earlier in December, Trump revived his Crooked Hillary nickname for Clinton and called her the biggest loser of all time. His decision to sign the tax overhaul into law before heading to Florida for the holidays had put Trump in a self-congratulatory mood."
"A U.S. appeals court on Thursday rejected for lack of standing a lawsuit alleging that President Donald Trump's commission on election fraud launched after he claimed without evidence that millions had voted illegally in 2016 was biased against voters of color. The ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans was a victory for the administration, which disbanded the commission in January 2018 before it could issue a final report, and members of the panel including Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. The lawsuit was filed by former members of the now-dissolved commission, the NAACP civil rights group and the Mexican American Legislative Caucus of the Texas House of Representatives. They had alleged the commission was stacked with Republicans and pursuing baseless claims of voter fraud as a pretext to facilitate efforts to suppress voting in particular by minority voters."
"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was sent an gift-wrapped box of horse manure that was eventually discovered by Los Angeles police, multiple media outlets reported on Saturday. The package was reportedly sent from a highrise apartment building in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles and was discovered by a police bomb squad after its delivery sparked concerns. According to reports, authorities initially responded to a call about a suspicious package that smelled of manure. Investigators then contacted a bomb squad, which determined the package contained a non-hazardous equine evacuated cargo -- or horse excrement, as one law enforcement official put it. No one had claimed responsibility for the package as of late Saturday evening. Mnuchin had served as Trump's campaign finance chairman before being tapped as Treasury secretary, and has faced criticism from some over the Republican tax overhaul signed into law last year."
"A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday partially lifted an order temporarily barring the Trump administration from moving ahead with new refugee screening procedures that had placed certain refugees in limbo. The ruling by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco came in a lawsuit brought by groups representing refugees that said some applicants were being unfairly barred under an October 2017 order by President Donald Trump aimed at increasing security vetting. Donato wrote that the groups were likely to prevail on their claim that certain refugees had a right to be reunited with families already living in the United States, so long as the refugees had already been vetted and approved for resettlement. The judge's ruling lifts his earlier order on an emergency, interim basis as it applied to that category of refugees. But the judge left in place his nationwide order halting other parts of Trump's order that tightened screening procedures for many refugees seeking admission to the United States."
"The U.S. Justice Department has issued a memo that seeks to undermine guidelines that have protected immigrant children who enter the United States without a parent or legal guardian, according to a copy of the memo obtained by Reuters. The internal memo from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel dated June 30 reviewed a longstanding 1997 legal opinion on the treatment of unaccompanied alien children by immigration authorities. That earlier memo delineated certain due process and child protection standards for immigrant minors. However, the new memo from the Trump administration states that many of the prior guidelines outlined in the 1997 opinion are no longer applicable, opening the door for officials to potentially remove some of those protections. The guidelines at issue stem from a 1997 legal opinion and settlement governing how to handle minors who enter the country illegally without parents or guardians and are placed in federal custody while their immigration cases are decided. Critics argue the new memo potentially paves the way for weakening protections for vulnerable immigrant children."
"A U.S. appeals court ruled on Thursday that President Donald Trump's latest travel ban on people entering the United States from six Muslim-majority countries should not be applied to people with close ties to the country. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted in part a request from the state of Hawaii for a more expansive exemption from Trump's directive blocking most people from Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, Chad and Somalia from traveling to the United States. The ruling means that people with close relatives already living in the U.S. cannot be barred from entry under Trump's order, which took effect in December. However, the appeals court upheld part of Trump's order that imposed a blanket ban on immigrants from the targeted countries unless they had ties to the U.S. such as a job or family connection. The court said its partial ruling exempting people with close U.S. ties would remain in place pending appeal."
"A second federal court rejected the Trump administration's request to put on hold an order allowing transgender people to join the U.S. military starting Jan. 1, dealing another legal blow to President Donald Trump's bid to bar transgender troops from serving. U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis in Baltimore ruled that the administration had failed to show why a stay of the policy change was warranted while it pursued an appeal. Last week, a federal judge in Washington also denied the government's request to delay an order allowing transgender military recruits to join the armed forces, setting the stage for the policy to take effect in the new year. The rulings represent setbacks for Trump, who announced in July that he would reverse course and ban transgender individuals from the military in order to avoid tremendous medical costs and disruption. The announcement upended a policy approved by the Defense Department in 2016 under former President Barack Obama to allow transgender people to serve."
"A failed attempt by Peru's opposition to oust President Pedro Castillo has shaken up the country's turbulent politics and raised new uncertainties about the leader's ability to govern. Castillo survived an impeachment vote by Congress late on March 28th after allegations of corruption and permanent moral incapacity, with 55 lawmakers voting in favor, 54 against and 19 abstaining â€“ falling short of the 87 votes needed to remove him from office. The political crisis laid bare bitter divisions between Castillo and the opposition-led Congress, which has accused him of actively undermining democracy barely eight months into his term. Castillo, a former teacher and member of a Marxist party, has decried what he calls efforts to unseat him almost since he took power in July last year. The impeachment process has stirred fresh protests by supporters and opponents of Castillo, who has struggled to cement his authority over a fragmented Congress determined to make him a lame duck leader. The standoff has heightened fears of prolonged instability in the world's No. 2 copper producer and raised questions about the 52-year-old president's ability to galvanize support from a divided country."
"President Donald Trump signed Republicans' massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul into law on Dec. 22, 2017, cementing the biggest legislative victory of his first year in office, and also averted a government shutdown by signing a short-term spending bill. At a hastily organized event at the White House, Trump celebrated with Republican lawmakers, crediting them for the largest tax cut in the history of our country. The tax legislation cuts the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, which Republicans say will spur economic growth and jobs. It also temporarily reduces tax rates for most individuals through 2025, provides a new tax credit for companies that bring cash back from overseas, and opens up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. On the spending bill, Trump said Americans could rest assured the military will be incredibly well-funded after signing a stopgap bill keeping the government operating through Jan. 19. The sweeping tax package sets the Republican-controlled Congress up for yet another challenging legislative fight in early 2018 over spending priorities and immigration policy."
"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday that public companies will have up to a year to take advantage of a new accounting standard on tax-bill reporting after President Donald Trump signed a sweeping tax overhaul into law. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board previously said companies would need to report the impact of the new Republican tax law in the quarterly and annual reports they prepare in the coming weeks. But in light of the potential magnitude of U.S. companies recalculating their taxes, the SEC said on Friday it would give companies more time. Companies now have a year to finalize accounting for taxes under the new law, which slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. The SEC said it will allow companies during that period to record reasonable estimates of taxes and report revised figures over the course of up to a year after the tax law's official Dec. 22 enactment date. The delay provides companies some leeway as they work to crunch numbers detailing both the reduction in their tax liabilities going forward and the immediate taxes due on past overseas profits being brought home."
"President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Dec. 22, 2017 to celebrate the passage of the Republican tax overhaul bill, calling it a massive tax cut for working families across America. He hailed the bill as the the largest tax cut in the history of our country. In a series of tweets, Trump also praised the House for approving a missile defense policy bill that included new sanctions against North Korea and expressed confidence it would also pass the Senate. The $1.5 trillion tax bill slashed the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and temporarily cut taxes for most households. Trump touted it as a monumental victory and the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history. However, the individual income tax rate reductions expire after 2025 and economists project the debt-financed tax cuts could add over $1 trillion to annual deficits over the coming decade. Trump also trumpeted the missile defense bill, which aims to further squeeze North Korea amid the nuclear crisis and restructure U.S. missile defenses. Missile Defense Bill passed by the House, sending a massive security enhancement over to the Senate, he tweeted. Must get NATO nations to pay MORE, getrid of the deficits."
"Mexico will review its tax laws to ensure its fiscal policy is competitive with the broad tax overhaul just enacted in the United States, according to a government document seen by Reuters on Dec. 26, 2017. The document, from Mexico's finance ministry, said the government would analyze whether tax changes were needed to respond to the U.S. tax reform signed into law by President Donald Trump. The reforms cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, potentially making it harder for Mexico to compete in attracting new investment. Mexico has aimed to lure manufacturing investment by offering lower labor costs and corporate tax rates than the United States. However, the U.S. tax overhaul narrows that advantage. The Mexican finance ministry document noted that pressure to remain competitive could require updating Mexico's tax rules and rates. But it cautioned that any reforms must avoid disruptions to public finances, which depend heavily on income from state oil company Pemex. The document said the government would specifically study adjusting corporate tax rates, allowing immediate deductions for investments to stimulate business spending, and providing tax incentives to boost reinvestment of profits in Mexico."
"U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell struck an optimistic tone for 2018 after a bitterly partisan 2017, saying he hoped to work with Democrats on issues like immigration, government spending and a new farm bill. In an interview with Reuters on Dec. 22, 2017, McConnell said the new year would likely start with renewed efforts to agree on federal spending caps for the next two years and to resolve the status of young immigrants brought into the United States illegally as children, an issue known as the Dreamers. The Republican leader expressed hope for a more collegial atmosphere in 2018 after years of sharp partisan fights. What I'm hoping is, with the major accomplishment of tax reform behind us now, we might return to a level of comity that could produce some real bipartisan efforts, he said. He cited the annual farm bill, an infrastructure initiative, and the status of the Dreamers as areas where the parties could cooperate. However, McConnell acknowledged bipartisan efforts could hit roadblocks, citing divisions over how much to spend on domestic programs and immigration. Still, he said compromise would be needed given Republicans' narrow 51-49 Senate majority, requiring some Democratic support to pass most legislation."
"Alabama was set to certify Democrat Doug Jones the winner of a special U.S. Senate election on Dec. 28, 2017, after a Republican campaign waged by President Donald Trump and other party leaders could not overcome allegations of sexual misconduct against the Republican candidate, Roy Moore. Jones' upset victory dealt a blow to Trump and allowed Republicans to keep hold of the Senate seat only until Nov. 2020, when the term expires and an election will again be held. Alabama's Republican Secretary of State John Merrill said his office would follow a federal court order to certify Jones later in the day, making the Democrat's Dec. 12 election win official. Jones is expected to take office early in January after the certification is completed. Moore, 70, a former Alabama chief justice, initially refused to concede defeat to Jones, a 63-year-old former federal prosecutor. Moore had been accused by several women of sexual misconduct when they were teens and he was in his 30s. He denied the allegations. The race took on national implications, with Trump and other party leaders waging an all-out campaign to support Moore. But Moore's victory could not overcome the allegations against him, which energized Alabama Democrats and contributed to higher-than-expected turnout among African American voters."
"Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has been asked to testify before the House of Representatives intelligence committee as part of its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. The request suggests the committee's probe is entering a new phase after Republican committee members released a memo accusing the FBI of bias against President Donald Trump in its Russia investigation. Bannon had a fraught tenure at the White House before resigning in August and returning to the right-wing news website Breitbart News. He was quoted in a book accusing Trump of meeting with Russians during the campaign, which the president has denied."
"After securing a major legislative victory with the passage of a sweeping tax overhaul, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated he was more comfortable with President Donald Trump's prolific use of Twitter. In an interview on Dec. 22, 2017, McConnell said he was a little more relaxed about Trump's tweets following the tax bill's approval, which represented the Republican party's first major policy achievement under Trump. It's certainly been a lot of fun for a lot of you in the media to follow his tweets, but at this particular point, we've actually gotten the tax bill passed despite the obstructionism of the Democrats, McConnell told reporters. McConnell had previously expressed concerns about Trump's frequent and often inflammatory tweets, worrying they could derail the Republican agenda in Congress. However, after the tax win, the Senate leader seemed more at ease with Trump's social media habits. I don't nitpick every tweet, as you've seen in the past, McConnell stated. But on the whole, achieving this extraordinarily difficult goal of tax reform - nobody thought we could do it - I think it's been helpful. McConnell's relaxed tone reflected a sense of accomplishment among Republicans after securing Trump's top legislative priority before the end of his first year in office."
